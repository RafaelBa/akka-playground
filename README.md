===============

This repo is for learning and tinkering. Code you see here is purely to learn or improve stuff. 
 - **workbench** holds code that is a try out to improve things and may pop up somewhere else
 - **learning** contains code that is pure learning, trying and getting used to stuff
 - remaining folders contain examples or projects that are a bit bigger than just a package, but technically they still count as **learning**
